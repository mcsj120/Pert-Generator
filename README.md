# CSE360-group-project
Group project for the class CSE360

This project was a collaboration for a Software Engineering course in collaboration with John Shaeffer, Jacob Baca, and Matthew Bohr. The project is a java application designed to generate the logic of a PERT Chart by giving it the nodes, along with that nodes dependencies, and then generate a graph based off of that. I was mainly responsible for the recursive generation of the nodes and the objected oriented approach to solving the problem.
